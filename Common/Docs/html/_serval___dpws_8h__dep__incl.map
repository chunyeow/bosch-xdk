The stack supports such a duty&#45;cycling mechanism by providing API functions to put the stack to sleep and to wake it up. In this case the stack must save its status into the non&#45;volatile memory before going to sleep and to recover it when it wakes up again. This header specifies the non&#45;volatile status of the stack in the struct NVData_S. " alt="" coords="31,109,185,180"/>
